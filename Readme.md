# Welcome

**Software Carpentry Bootcamp 2012 at Johns Hopkins University**

## How ?

Before you come to the bootcamp, you will need to bring a laptop with which to follow along interactively with the tutorials. In order to do this, you will need to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), download 
[this virtual machine image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/SWC_JHU2012/swc_jhu2012_r03.ova), and open the image using VirtualBox.

By doing so, you will have, on your laptop, a virtual environment pre-loaded with all of the necessary software (a terminal, text editors, git, ipython, numpy, and other python packages) for the tutorial. 

## Where?

The Software Carpentry Bootcamp at Johns Hopkins University will be located
at [Room 475, Bloomberg Center for Physics & Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University](http://goo.gl/maps/YUHI).    

## When ?

The bootcamp will last from 9am to 4:30pm on June 18 and 19, 2012. There
will be an hour lunch break at 12:15pm on both days (lunch not provided). There will also be coffee breaks intermittently throughout the days.

## Who?

The bootcamp will be led by Matt Davis, Michael Droettboom, Joshua R. Smith, and Sasha Wood. It was organized by Software Carpentry, an online
compendium of resources for scientific computation.
